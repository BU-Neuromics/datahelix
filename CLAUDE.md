# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

This is the **platform integration repository** for the **DataHelix** platform. It hosts cross-cutting platform docs, the unified mkdocs site, and cross-component integration tests under `tests/platform/` and `tests/contracts/`. Component source code lives in component directories — some in-tree, some as git submodules pointing at standalone component repos.

## Repository Layout

```

```

**Components:** Mosaic (formerly Hippo, ADR-0004; LinkML runtime — the platform's structured domain graph; metadata tracking is one application — submodule at [BU-Neuromics/mosaic](https://github.com/BU-Neuromics/mosaic)), Cappella (workflow engine), Aperture (interface layer — AI-native data & workflow explorer; the config-driven portal is its substrate — submodule at [BU-Neuromics/aperture](https://github.com/BU-Neuromics/aperture)), Bridge (integration middleware / auth gateway — the platform's sole PEP/PDP). Hippo was split out 2026-05-25 (see `proposals/hippo-split.md`); Aperture was split out 2026-06-13 as a fresh start carrying only the Hippo backend protocol + portal design (see `proposals/aperture-split.md`). The remaining in-tree components are expected to follow the same pattern.

**Working with submodules:** Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

1. Work starts in `datahelix/`. `git submodule status` shows the commit each component is pinned at.
2. To change a component, `cd datahelix/<component>`, create a branch (submodules sit on a
   detached HEAD at the pinned tag), commit, push, open the PR **in that component's repo**.
3. After the component releases, bump the pin in datahelix: in `datahelix/<component>`
   `git checkout <tag>`, then in `datahelix/` `git add <component>` and commit
   ("Bump <component> to vX.Y.Z"), PR to datahelix.
4. Never edit a component and leave it uncommitted inside datahelix — the parent repo only
   records the commit pointer.

## GitHub

- Orgs: **BU-Neuromics** (datahelix, mosaic, aperture, reel, mosaic-demo-small,
  linkml-data-gen) and **VA-NCPTSDBB-Bioinformatics** (brainbank-hippo-schema, docs site,
  ncptsdbb-db-app).
- File issues in the repo that owns the code; cross-component work gets a datahelix umbrella
  issue linking the component issues (the #93 pattern).
- Never force-push; never push straight to `main` — branch + PR.

## Key Conventions

- Each component's design spec is split into numbered section files (`sec1_overview.md`, `sec2_architecture.md`, etc.) with explicit `Depends on` / `Feeds into` headers for cross-referencing.
- The Mosaic `design/INDEX.md` tracks section status (complete, in review, not started), key decisions, and open questions. Other components follow the same pattern.
- **Design decisions are recorded as ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records), one file per decision in each component's `design/decisions/`, following the platform-wide convention in [`platform/design/decisions/README.md`](platform/design/decisions/README.md). Each component's `design/INDEX.md` Decision Log indexes its ADRs; platform-wide (cross-component) decisions live in `platform/design/decisions/`. New/non-trivial decisions get an ADR; mature components (Mosaic) adopt forward-only (no mass backfill). Aperture's `design/decisions/` is the reference implementation.
- Design specs feed into the **openplan** pipeline: `Spec sections → vision.yaml → roadmap → epics → features → OpenSpec`.
- The `.gitignore` excludes `.obsidian/` (Obsidian editor config).

## Writing Guidelines

- Design spec sections should be self-contained and reference dependencies on other sections explicitly.
- Mosaic is the most developed component; use its spec structure as the template when drafting specs for other components.
- The platform uses an **SDK-first** architecture — business logic in Python SDK, REST/GraphQL as thin transport wrappers. Keep this principle consistent across all component docs.
- Mosaic's data model uses a **config-driven relational** approach with a graph-shaped API and schemas authored directly in LinkML.
